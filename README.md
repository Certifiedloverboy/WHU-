## Course Project

*We split the course project into four parts.*


* PART1 Haoran Liang(**Group Leader**): Sentiment Analysis Based on Naive Bayes


* PART2 Bingqi Chen: Textblob-based sentiment analysis


* PART3 Zhaoxiang Wang: Sentiment Analysis Based on NRC Dictionary


* PART4 Wei Xu: Sentiment Analysis Based on HOWNET Dictionary

## Text Mining Learning Documents

* The text mining learning document is a learning document suitable for beginners that I organized when I was learning text mining


* The document contains files in **ipynb format** and **html format**, of which the html format file is for the convenience of the instructor

## Distribution of Project Report and Final Presentation

The content was completed by the team members, the group leader Liang summarized the content, and Xu completed the final beautification.

## Brief Introduction

As an engineering student, it is highly desirable for me to apply the knowledge which I learned from **Python Programming** and **Machine Learning** to some engineering topics, but all of my teammates are from non-engineering majors. So we picked up a **Natural Language Processing** topic which could also boost the robustness of what I've learned from ML and Python Programming. What's more, the data processing part of NLP and ML which applies to structural engineer is quite similiar.


**WHAT WE DO**:


* Defined appropriate datasets for language learning based on the knowledge gained from Machine Learning


* Designed and developed a natural language processing model based on Naive Bayes by Python


* Trained the developed model and ran evaluation experiments


* Performed statistical analysis of results by OriginLab and finished the final report and presentation

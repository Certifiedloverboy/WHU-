patterns anticipated early social science theorists gabriel de tarde park et al 2018 study extremely longrange ties using data produced twitter via international phone calls their findings challenge longheld belief social relationships connect clusters individuals within networks usually weak ie based acquaintances rather close friends in contrast show longrange network connectionsalthough rareare often strong connect close circle friends another line research examines network dynamics via online games shirado christakis 2017 recruited participants play game required coordinate colors within matrix by introducing bots simulated human agents playing game poorly able improve coordination among human respondents study in another experiment respondents occupied hypothetical neighborhoods asked share wifi shirado et al 2019 examined network brokerage shapes inequality they find wellconnected individuals suffer many others come depend services online games also influential studying wisdom crowds political beliefs guilbeault et al 2018 example show diverse political groups produce accurate estimates political facts anonymous less accurate estimates political identities revealed becker et al 2019 show wisdom crowds also improves estimation politically homogeneous settings finally games used study collective dynamics broadly centola et al 2018 created game groups respondents asked determine appropriate names avatars they showed network properties enable small factions study participants overturn preexisting consensus among prevailing majorities collective behavior and political sociology computational social science inspired considerable work collective behavior politics data social media communication platforms advanced study collective behavior

unpopular campaigns encounter unexpected revivals vaillant et al 2015 elsewhere proliferation textbased data inspired new work political discourse recent work bail 2015 bonikowski gidron 2016 demonstrates fringe discourse enter mainstream analyzing social position actors within discursive fields emotional valence language scholars also use text data examine certain discursive styles prove effective others advocacy groups bail 2015 2016a bail et al 2017 discuss additional detail other studies examine interaction political discourse policy change flores 2017 example uses text data twitter show antiimmigration laws hardened public opinion immigration arizona textbased research also examined elites shape political discourseboth across elite fields eg journalism politics celebrities across countries almaghlouth et al 2015 wells et al 2016 finally many studies examine political polarization persuasion using online data automated text analysis experiments agentbased modeling these studies investigate political tribes form highlight role echo chambers create selective exposure information networkbased research suggests polarization arises homophily among conservatives extremists boutyline willer 2017 well general homophily peer influence processes dellaposta et al 2015 research using methods notes patterns donations candidates grown polarized recent decades heerwig 2017 donations elites drive belief polarization farrell 2016a computational sociologists also performed experiments learn partisans change beliefs as noted becker et al 2019 find politically homogeneous groups make better decisions online games at time research reveals exposure opposing views create backfire effects bail et al 2018b paid twitter users follow bots exposed opposing political views found treatment increased partisanship still studies indicate minimizing signals partisan identity guilbeault et al 2018 using specific moral language feinberg willer 2015 matching linguistic styles romero et al 2015 may help reduce polarization sociology of knowledge computational social science become central part sociology knowledge one strand research employs citation data study consensus formation within science building shwed bearman 2010 influential study light adams 2015 analyze citation networks determine consensus outcomes children samesex parents arises among scholars focusing temporal patterns identify point scientific consensus emerged children samesex parents show marked differences sexual orientation compared parental configurations bruggeman et al 2012 demonstrate importance differentiating citations signal agreement citations signal disagreement using simulations find small proportions citations contentious significant effects whether citation networks signal consensus now bibliographic data become easier collect analyze scale scholars map model processes shape scientific fields whole the metaknowledge program university chicago sociologist james evans exemplifies research eg evans foster 2011 this includes studies trace increasing dominance teamwork science for example wuchty et al 2007 show social sciences propensity work teams doubled past five decades others show small teams tend produce work introduces novel disruptive ideas science technology whereas large teams tend develop existing ideas wu et al 2019 advances text analysis enabled scholars shed new light similarities differences disciplines well eg evans et al 2016 mcmahan evans 2018 vilhena et al 2014 for example mcmahan evans 2018 develop measure capture ambiguity language within scientific articles they find expressions used consistently biological chemical sciences least consistently humanities law environmental sciences ambiguous language also produces integrated citation streams stimulates involved academic debate vilhena et al 2014 draw concept cultural holes map differences disciplinary jargon within across fields although languagebased gaps map neatly onto structural holes within citation networks nevertheless inhibit efficient communication scientists shi et al 2015 go step model generative process underlying entire field they show biomedical research conceptualized dynamic network evolves according ways scientists link theory methods across time another strand literature examines academic work gains impact prestige uzzi et al 2013 example show highimpact publications build prior work yet simultaneously feature unusual novel combinations within sociology leahey moody 2014 show articles span subfields garner citations likely appear prestigious journals still others created large databases academic prizes eg li et al 2019 using data ma uzzi 2018 study worldwide network academic prizewinners 100 years they show relatively small number prizes scholars push boundaries science whereas increasing number prizes remains concentrated small circle scientific elites computational approaches also reveal scientific discoveries driven choices individual scientists organizational contexts rzhetsky et al 2015 example identify strategies scientists biomedicine follow choosing relationships molecules study they show strategies reflect personal career choices demonstrate increased risktaking publishing research failures could improve scientific discovery field whole see also foster et al 2015 others focus organizational context for example rawlings et al 2015 rawlings mcfarland 2011 identify organizational structure one prominent university shapes peer influence academic funding proposals noting increasing dominance faculty members flow knowledge measured terms citation histories another strand work area employs computational techniques study public face science science interfaces industry for example shwed 2015 shows attempts tobacco industry hamper scientific inquiry paradoxically enabled scientists discover perils smoking farrell 2016a b examines privatesector influence shaped debate anthropogenic climate change his analysis reveals corporate funding influences content prevalence polarizing themes debate time still others combine network analysis text analysis better understand scientists position public debates for example edelmann et al 2017 study controversy use potentially pandemic pathogens biomedical research they find peer effects research specializations shape positions scientists publicly support debate scholars also explored public consumption science turning toward online purchasing data studying millions online book purchases example shi et al 2017 reveal partisan interests science consumers liberalleaning political books prefer basic science whereas customers conservative books tend prefer applied commercial science this implies science might bridge reinforce political differences within general public finally computational work reveals gender asymmetries inequalities within science representation knowledge online generally for example drawing data jstor one largest digital repositories academic journals west et al 2013 trace gender inequalities scholarly authorship across natural sciences social sciences humanities since 1545 even women men appear similar publication counts study shows men continue dominate singleauthored papers prestigious first last author positions in another study king et al 2017 show men likely cite womena tendency increased past two decades finally wagner et al 2016 focus representation women wikipedia they find ceiling effects curb entry women identify linguistic differences achievements women men describedas well differences metadata imply asymmetries wider reception articles written men women online cultural sociology social psychology and emotions computational social science also appears study cultural sociology social psychology emotions within cultural sociology several studies examine broad processes cultural change bail 2015 shows automated text analysis used examine transformation discursive fields ann swidler calls unsettled times order develop systematic theory resonanceor certain cultural messages natural advantage others in followup work bail 2016b identifies carrying capacity within discursive fields messaging strategies attract attention cover diverse range subjects messages combine many themes less impactful bail 2016a also develops theory cultural bridging indicates organizations adopt brokerage positions within discursive fields likely attract large audiences other studies document similar cultural processes scientific fields markets corporations goldberg et al 2016a b vilhena et al 2014 discuss elsewhere article finally kozlowski et al 2019 use word embeddings examine largescale shifts meaning terms associated class gender united states united kingdom time the growth textbased data also opened new lines inquiry cultural messages expressed much research involves data collected facebook twitter for example golder macy 2011 track frequency language associated different types emotions discovered evidence diurnal rhythms other work reveals emotional contagion public discussions public health issues facebook likelihood exposure emotional language makes social media users likely become emotional themselvesand thus likely interact emotional content well bail 2016c bail et al 2017 identify call cognitiveemotional currents discussions alternating surges rational emotional styles language this work thus feeds broader discussions role hot cold processing within human brain explains social context shape expressive styles spread across social networks time in addition text analysis scholars pioneering use virtual reality examine core questions social psychology for example van loon et al 2018 paid university students perform collaborative tasks randomized half treatment condition used virtual reality take perspective research participants this intervention increased prosocial behavior another line research contributes theories phenomenology smallgroup processes using virtual reality schroeder 2010 although virtual realitybased research exploding adjacent social science fields psychology sociology slow integrate new technology this surprising virtual reality holds great promise studying people respond social settings within tightly controlled experiments also sociologists conducted earliest research virtual communities eg gamson peppers 1966 production of culture computational approaches often used study people evaluate cultural products music art films in influential study salganik et al 2006 created online music lab study peer influence shapes musical preferences new artists in experiment participants rated music obscure bands in control condition participants received information popularity whereas treatment condition shown many times songs downloaded treated respondents likely listen songs high download rates rate songs positively although songs treatment condition followed selffulfilling prophecywhere false popularity became real timea followup study revealed highestquality songs recovered popularity time salganik watts 2008 van de rijt 2019 other studies explore dynamics critical acclaim for example previous work finds age music film genre sponsorship major production company increase likelihood industry accolades music film light odden 2017 rossman schilke 2014 computational work also measures combinations themes cultural products shape reception using data spotify billboard askin mauskapf 2017 find songs perform best sound similar songs chart year include minor diversions themes well other research suggests tastes atypicality vary across demographics class race geographical location some people prefer products food filmthat fit cleanly single category whereas others prefer novel combinations themes multiple categories those prefer items single categories time represent traditional omnivore hypothesis they taste authenticity multiple categoriesno categorical mixingwhich signals high status goldberg 2016a yet studies also indicate tastes stratified regional differences interest certain ingredients recipes influenced location wagner et al 2014 by considering characteristics products consumers tandem researchers developing comprehensive theory taste consumption patterns align another line studies examines social networks individuals shape creation cultural objectsoften focus novelty innovation for instance de vaan et al 2015 use large database videogame production credits demonstrate crosscutting teams developers create products creative popular analyzing networks hollywood actors rossman et al 2010 show status transferred people work together in case actor likely receive oscar nominationan important consecration event film industrywhen appear film alongside highstatus actor finally recent studies examine gender class political identities shape production cultural products shor et al 2015 example find men featured often media women journalists focus highstatus topics typically focus men a largescale historical analysis google books data shows mentions social class class struggle terms describe social class increase alongside economic misery indexa measure inflation unemployment chen yan 2016 finally hoffman 2019 uses combination text analysis network analysis study reading patterns shape political ideology vice versa using records large public library economic sociology and organizations the intersection computational network methods also flourishing within economic sociology email instant messaging archives create large dynamic networks individuals organizationsa significant improvement data generated via selfreports early exchanges among individuals organizationsfor instance patient transfers hospitalsshape evolution social networks allocation resources horvát et al 2015 kitts et al 2017 elsewhere instant messaging data reveal social balance theory predicts streaks high performance among day traders askarisichani et al 2019 messaging data also allow researchers measure level coordination among employees economic decision making show synchronous communication increases profitability trades saavedra et al 2011 finally network data improved study social capital career outcomes for example studies indicate certain network compositions benefit women differently men lutter 2015 for example women likely succeed part inner circle within network predominantly female yang et al 2019 network data useful studying exchange career outcomes also organizational culture goldberg et al 2016b analyze email messages within large corporation measure whether employees communications fit within prevailing norms behavior employees integrate organizational culture receive variety rewards less likely fired srivastava et al 2018 in addition network data digitized records textual communications provide richer understanding role culture emotions marketplace using text analysis studies reveal market volatility influences whether traders discussing current future conditions shifts shape trading behavior saavedra et al 2011 other studies indicate individuals exhibit moderate levels emotions communication employees make profitable stock trades liu et al 2016 finally schnable 2016 combines qualitative methods automated text analysis study religion provides grassroots ngos cultural frames allow claim legitimacy build social networks secure funding resources demography and population studies computational social

critical litmus test machine learning within population scienceand social science broadly conclusion as review illustrates field computational social science expanding many exciting new directionsindeed expanding rapidly review literature become outmoded within short order still preliminary review indicates computational social science become central part research across many different subfields perhaps importantly field moved far beyond descriptive social media research characterized much early work field indeed sociologists developed range hybrid methodologies combine computational approaches conventional techniques take advantage promise digital data sources addressing limitations well yet sociologists also rapidly pursuing cutting edge new technologies well although machine learning yet watershed moment within sociology artificial intelligence bots virtual reality already offer sociologists powerful new suite techniques study social relationships form evolve across contexts using computational social science build theories human behavior importantly review also indicates sociologists contributing new methods computational social science also major

realworld data questionable crooks et al 2008 undoubtedly difficulties reduce interest cognitively grounded models simulators although latter foundations much firmer models used the lesson one might draw like scientific developments often due practical utility theoretical soundness however little success cognitively grounded agentbased models also due factors first unlike theorygrounded agent models example rational models cognitive models prescriptive whereas theory rationality theory action cognitive modeling provides theories agent hence rational agent model fits apparently better objectives abm simulation allows modeler get rid tricky part modeling agents form goals motivations preferences implied decisions 232 generative models secondly cognitive modeling truly generative theory behavior accounting behavior terms mechanisms supposed operate producing a generative explanation observed social phenomenon consists describing terms external environmental social internal behavioral mechanisms generate rather inferring causes observed covariations this vital property explanation easily realized otherwise when describing agent behavior means formalisms logicbased numeric describe behavior outside perceived observer describe way generated abm explains behavior within terms mechanisms supposed generated mechanisms operate agent she behaves one way another of course behavior explained otherwise for example flight hawks wonderfully explained mathematical property logarithmic spiral tangent center spiral yields angle width thanks property hawks keep preys always aim describing spiral pouncing but explanation generative sense tell us internal mechanisms allowing hawks fly way for sure hawks fly based understanding properties logarithmic spiral how show corresponding behavior the often invoked evolutionary explanation offers poor help accounts behavior terms reproductive advantage as spirallike flight proved advantageous hawks performed able generate offspring others extinguished no generative theory tells us hawks produce behavior question we could use mathematical theory describe behavior incorporate mathematical explanation set adhoc behavioral rules reproducing but neither mathematical explanation describes internal causes set adhoc rules generative now fully generative explanation implies general theory external causes including fitnessenhancing effects get converted internal reasons sometimes called proximate causes behavior agentbased models often limited focus easily compatible temporal perspective theoretical requirements fully generative sense intended explanation do always need generative explanation not really adhoc rules sometimes needed explain behavior this case entirely programmed organisms may even case hawks far know sometimes instead need suppose want hawk learn new trick respect approach behavior that nature form new environment perhaps letting imagination run wild form prey develops counterstrategy spiral then immediately flight generated becomes important much learned much hard wired plastic neuronal connection fixed relative placement eye bone suddenly reproduce behavior would need rigid set rules need know generated cognitive modeling aims finding general mechanisms yielding wide spectrum behaviors relatively autonomous systems of course need mechanisms simply reproduce behavior the specific target behavior lesser need cognitive agentbased model since abm often used investigate fairly specific phenomena either mathematical model set adhoc rule preferred cognitive modeling but together cognitive modeling also dispense away truly generative modeling 24 why bother with generative explanation one might say cares provided reproduce behavior observe make artificial experiments optimize bother theorydriven generative modeling there several reasons one truly generative explanation needed model complex social dynamics for universal admission dynamics social entities phenomena

mathematical equations account phenomena explained with support observation data gathering parameters assigned correct values although theoretical framework often much simple general program scarcely interdisciplinary ambition social impact mainly based rather prescriptive view microlevel theory deductive css yielded foundational general explanatory theory social systems a lesson forget 32 the

telecommunications data demonstrate strong relationship network diversity economic development various theories group formation eg eagle et al 2010 more recent studies employ digital data sources examine diffusion complex contagions social networks centola 2010 example created online community could control topology social networks this work shows diffusions much likely reach individuals tightly clustered networks organized random other research showed network topology also shape adoption social conventions centola baronchelli 2015 social media telecommunications data also enable analyses networks unprecedented scale bail et al 2017 employ facebook data identify synergy diffusion emotional rational communicative styles large network people discussing public health issues in another study bail et al 2019 use google search data track diffusion cultural products across global networks together studies show microlevel interactions individuals generate macrolevel diffusion patterns anticipated early social science theorists gabriel de tarde park et al 2018 study extremely longrange ties using data produced twitter via international phone calls their findings challenge longheld belief social relationships connect clusters individuals within networks usually weak ie based acquaintances rather close friends in contrast show longrange network connectionsalthough rareare often strong connect close circle friends another line research examines network dynamics via online games shirado christakis 2017 recruited participants play game required coordinate colors within matrix by introducing bots simulated human agents playing game poorly able improve coordination among human respondents study in another experiment respondents occupied hypothetical neighborhoods asked share wifi shirado et al 2019 examined network brokerage shapes inequality they find wellconnected individuals suffer many others come depend services online games also influential studying wisdom crowds political beliefs guilbeault et al 2018 example show diverse political groups produce accurate estimates political facts anonymous less accurate estimates political identities revealed becker et al 2019 show wisdom crowds also improves estimation politically homogeneous settings finally games used study collective dynamics broadly centola et al 2018 created game groups respondents asked determine appropriate names avatars they showed network properties enable small factions study participants overturn preexisting consensus among prevailing majorities collective behavior and political sociology computational social science inspired considerable work collective behavior politics data social media communication platforms advanced study collective behavior

unpopular campaigns encounter unexpected revivals vaillant et al 2015 elsewhere proliferation textbased data inspired new work political discourse recent work bail 2015 bonikowski gidron 2016 demonstrates fringe discourse enter mainstream analyzing social position actors within discursive fields emotional valence language scholars also use text data examine certain discursive styles prove effective others advocacy groups bail 2015 2016a bail et al 2017 discuss additional detail other studies examine interaction political discourse policy change flores 2017 example uses text data twitter show antiimmigration laws hardened public opinion immigration arizona textbased research also examined elites shape political discourseboth across elite fields eg journalism politics celebrities across countries almaghlouth et al 2015 wells et al 2016 finally many studies examine political polarization persuasion using online data automated text analysis experiments agentbased modeling these studies investigate political tribes form highlight role echo chambers create selective exposure information networkbased research suggests polarization arises homophily among conservatives extremists boutyline willer 2017 well general homophily peer influence processes dellaposta et al 2015 research using methods notes patterns donations candidates grown polarized recent decades heerwig 2017 donations elites drive belief polarization farrell 2016a computational sociologists also performed experiments learn partisans change beliefs as noted becker et al 2019 find politically homogeneous groups make better decisions online games at time research reveals exposure opposing views create backfire effects bail et al 2018b paid twitter users follow bots exposed opposing political views found treatment increased partisanship still studies indicate minimizing signals partisan identity guilbeault et al 2018 using specific moral language feinberg willer 2015 matching linguistic styles romero et al 2015 may help reduce polarization sociology of knowledge computational social science become central part sociology knowledge one strand research employs citation data study consensus formation within science building shwed bearman 2010 influential study light adams 2015 analyze citation networks determine consensus outcomes children samesex parents arises among scholars focusing temporal patterns identify point scientific consensus emerged children samesex parents show marked differences sexual orientation compared parental configurations bruggeman et al 2012 demonstrate importance differentiating citations signal agreement citations signal disagreement using simulations find small proportions citations contentious significant effects whether citation networks signal consensus now bibliographic data become easier collect analyze scale scholars map model processes shape scientific fields whole the metaknowledge program university chicago sociologist james evans exemplifies research eg evans foster 2011 this includes studies trace increasing dominance teamwork science for example wuchty et al 2007 show social sciences propensity work teams doubled past five decades others show small teams tend produce work introduces novel disruptive ideas science technology whereas large teams tend develop existing ideas wu et al 2019 advances text analysis enabled scholars shed new light similarities differences disciplines well eg evans et al 2016 mcmahan evans 2018 vilhena et al 2014 for example mcmahan evans 2018 develop measure capture ambiguity language within scientific articles they find expressions used consistently biological chemical sciences least consistently humanities law environmental sciences ambiguous language also produces integrated citation streams stimulates involved academic debate vilhena et al 2014 draw concept cultural holes map differences disciplinary jargon within across fields although languagebased gaps map neatly onto structural holes within citation networks nevertheless inhibit efficient communication scientists shi et al 2015 go step model generative process underlying entire field they show biomedical research conceptualized dynamic network evolves according ways scientists link theory methods across time another strand literature examines academic work gains impact prestige uzzi et al 2013 example show highimpact publications build prior work yet simultaneously feature unusual novel combinations within sociology leahey moody 2014 show articles span subfields garner citations likely appear prestigious journals still others created large databases academic prizes eg li et al 2019 using data ma uzzi 2018 study worldwide network academic prizewinners 100 years they show relatively small number prizes scholars push boundaries science whereas increasing number prizes remains concentrated small circle scientific elites computational approaches also reveal scientific discoveries driven choices individual scientists organizational contexts rzhetsky et al 2015 example identify strategies scientists biomedicine follow choosing relationships molecules study they show strategies reflect personal career choices demonstrate increased risktaking publishing research failures could improve scientific discovery field whole see also foster et al 2015 others focus organizational context for example rawlings et al 2015 rawlings mcfarland 2011 identify organizational structure one prominent university shapes peer influence academic funding proposals noting increasing dominance faculty members flow knowledge measured terms citation histories another strand work area employs computational techniques study public face science science interfaces industry for example shwed 2015 shows attempts tobacco industry hamper scientific inquiry paradoxically enabled scientists discover perils smoking farrell 2016a b examines privatesector influence shaped debate anthropogenic climate change his analysis reveals corporate funding influences content prevalence polarizing themes debate time still others combine network analysis text analysis better understand scientists position public debates for example edelmann et al 2017 study controversy use potentially pandemic pathogens biomedical research they find peer effects research specializations shape positions scientists publicly support debate scholars also explored public consumption science turning toward online purchasing data studying millions online book purchases example shi et al 2017 reveal partisan interests science consumers liberalleaning political books prefer basic science whereas customers conservative books tend prefer applied commercial science this implies science might bridge reinforce political differences within general public finally computational work reveals gender asymmetries inequalities within science representation knowledge online generally for example drawing data jstor one largest digital repositories academic journals west et al 2013 trace gender inequalities scholarly authorship across natural sciences social sciences humanities since 1545 even women men appear similar publication counts study shows men continue dominate singleauthored papers prestigious first last author positions in another study king et al 2017 show men likely cite womena tendency increased past two decades finally wagner et al 2016 focus representation women wikipedia they find ceiling effects curb entry women identify linguistic differences achievements women men describedas well differences metadata imply asymmetries wider reception articles written men women online cultural sociology social psychology and emotions computational social science also appears study cultural sociology social psychology emotions within cultural sociology several studies examine broad processes cultural change bail 2015 shows automated text analysis used examine transformation discursive fields ann swidler calls unsettled times order develop systematic theory resonanceor certain cultural messages natural advantage others in followup work bail 2016b identifies carrying capacity within discursive fields messaging strategies attract attention cover diverse range subjects messages combine many themes less impactful bail 2016a also develops theory cultural bridging indicates organizations adopt brokerage positions within discursive fields likely attract large audiences other studies document similar cultural processes scientific fields markets corporations goldberg et al 2016a b vilhena et al 2014 discuss elsewhere article finally kozlowski et al 2019 use word embeddings examine largescale shifts meaning terms associated class gender united states united kingdom time the growth textbased data also opened new lines inquiry cultural messages expressed much research involves data collected facebook twitter for example golder macy 2011 track frequency language associated different types emotions discovered evidence diurnal rhythms other work reveals emotional contagion public discussions public health issues facebook likelihood exposure emotional language makes social media users likely become emotional themselvesand thus likely interact emotional content well bail 2016c bail et al 2017 identify call cognitiveemotional currents discussions alternating surges rational emotional styles language this work thus feeds broader discussions role hot cold processing within human brain explains social context shape expressive styles spread across social networks time in addition text analysis scholars pioneering use virtual reality examine core questions social psychology for example van loon et al 2018 paid university students perform collaborative tasks randomized half treatment condition used virtual reality take perspective research participants this intervention increased prosocial behavior another line research contributes theories phenomenology smallgroup processes using virtual reality schroeder 2010 although virtual realitybased research exploding adjacent social science fields psychology sociology slow integrate new technology this surprising virtual reality holds great promise studying people respond social settings within tightly controlled experiments also sociologists conducted earliest research virtual communities eg gamson peppers 1966 production of culture computational approaches often used study people evaluate cultural products music art films in influential study salganik et al 2006 created online music lab study peer influence shapes musical preferences new artists in experiment participants rated music obscure bands in control condition participants received information popularity whereas treatment condition shown many times songs downloaded treated respondents likely listen songs high download rates rate songs positively although songs treatment condition followed selffulfilling prophecywhere false popularity became real timea followup study revealed highestquality songs recovered popularity time salganik watts 2008 van de rijt 2019 other studies explore dynamics critical acclaim for example previous work finds age music film genre sponsorship major production company increase likelihood industry accolades music film light odden 2017 rossman schilke 2014 computational work also measures combinations themes cultural products shape reception using data spotify billboard askin mauskapf 2017 find songs perform best sound similar songs chart year include minor diversions themes well other research suggests tastes atypicality vary across demographics class race geographical location some people prefer products food filmthat fit cleanly single category whereas others prefer novel combinations themes multiple categories those prefer items single categories time represent traditional omnivore hypothesis they taste authenticity multiple categoriesno categorical mixingwhich signals high status goldberg 2016a yet studies also indicate tastes stratified regional differences interest certain ingredients recipes influenced location wagner et al 2014 by considering characteristics products consumers tandem researchers developing comprehensive theory taste consumption patterns align another line studies examines social networks individuals shape creation cultural objectsoften focus novelty innovation for instance de vaan et al 2015 use large database videogame production credits demonstrate crosscutting teams developers create products creative popular analyzing networks hollywood actors rossman et al 2010 show status transferred people work together in case actor likely receive oscar nominationan important consecration event film industrywhen appear film alongside highstatus actor finally recent studies examine gender class political identities shape production cultural products shor et al 2015 example find men featured often media women journalists focus highstatus topics typically focus men a largescale historical analysis google books data shows mentions social class class struggle terms describe social class increase alongside economic misery indexa measure inflation unemployment chen yan 2016 finally hoffman 2019 uses combination text analysis network analysis study reading patterns shape political ideology vice versa using records large public library economic sociology and organizations the intersection computational network methods also flourishing within economic sociology email instant messaging archives create large dynamic networks individuals organizationsa significant improvement data generated via selfreports early exchanges among individuals organizationsfor instance patient transfers hospitalsshape evolution social networks allocation resources horvát et al 2015 kitts et al 2017 elsewhere instant messaging data reveal social balance theory predicts streaks high performance among day traders askarisichani et al 2019 messaging data also allow researchers measure level coordination among employees economic decision making show synchronous communication increases profitability trades saavedra et al 2011 finally network data improved study social capital career outcomes for example studies indicate certain network compositions benefit women differently men lutter 2015 for example women likely succeed part inner circle within network predominantly female yang et al 2019 network data useful studying exchange career outcomes also organizational culture goldberg et al 2016b analyze email messages within large corporation measure whether employees communications fit within prevailing norms behavior employees integrate organizational culture receive variety rewards less likely fired srivastava et al 2018 in addition network data digitized records textual communications provide richer understanding role culture emotions marketplace using text analysis studies reveal market volatility influences whether traders discussing current future conditions shifts shape trading behavior saavedra et al 2011 other studies indicate individuals exhibit moderate levels emotions communication employees make profitable stock trades liu et al 2016 finally schnable 2016 combines qualitative methods automated text analysis study religion provides grassroots ngos cultural frames allow claim legitimacy build social networks secure funding resources demography and population studies computational social science emerged within demography relatively recently rapidly gaining popularity cesare et al 2018 unsurprisingly computational approaches often used produce highquality population estimates mobile

critical litmus test machine learning within population scienceand social science broadly conclusion as review illustrates field computational social science expanding many exciting new directionsindeed expanding rapidly review literature become outmoded within short order still preliminary review indicates computational social science become central part research across many different subfields perhaps importantly field moved far beyond descriptive social media research characterized much early work field indeed sociologists developed range hybrid methodologies combine computational approaches conventional techniques take advantage promise digital data sources addressing limitations well yet sociologists also rapidly pursuing cutting edge new technologies well although machine learning yet watershed moment within sociology artificial intelligence bots virtual reality already offer sociologists powerful new suite techniques study social relationships form evolve across contexts using computational social science build theories human behavior importantly review also indicates sociologists contributing new methods computational social science also major theoretical advances wellwhich view key continued expansion field mainstream sociology there multiple ways theoretical advances made via computational social science first many studies using new types data methods revisit old sociological questions thought impossible study examples include new macrolevel theories social networks cultural change well microlevel theories human decision making yet work scratches surface full potential computational social science advance theory development across multiple levels analysis in view influential work within computational social science within coming years type able link macro levels theories topics cultural change microlevel processes decision making such efforts likely possible social media data administrative records new sources digital data alone rather require creative hybrid methods illuminate space different levels analysis a second way computational social science advance theoretical progress sociology develop new theories social terra incognita created rise digital technology these include novel theories digital protest consumption cultural products spread knowledge onlineto name many studies examined new spacesparticularly within realm politics networks communication but number new social spacesand new forms social relationships enableare currently outpacing evolution sociological theory perhaps obvious example manner machine learning artificial intelligence currently recasting way communicate otherwhich may ultimately create new forms social segregation shape evolution networks sociologists also left mostly untheorized ways interaction machines shape patterns human behavior social organization well if sociologists rise new challenges fields indeed majority theorizing broader field computational social science outside sociology either inattentive sociological theory focuses handful influential ideaswe believe sociologists need insert conversations proactively demonstrating core tenets sociological theory social construction reality selffulfilling prophecies advance study many new social spaces created recent decades finally sociologists use tools computational social science develop new ways creating theory although becoming increasingly clear machine learning easily allow us reverseengineer collective behavior culture human decision making systematically use tools identify new dimensions social behavior test robustness existing accounts this probably proceed naturally comparing gap predictions produced models underlying realityeither variablebyvariable basis systematically testing permutations different variables might enable us identify unforeseen complexity human behavior otherwise identify blind spots finally scholars also creating theories interfacing fields comparing theories human behavior computing artificial intelligence example opens exciting new lines inquiry nature social life eg foster 2018 taken extreme also use line theoretical development compare precisely differences artificial human intelligence help us develop deeper understanding social processesparticularly easily articulated may difficult machine observe outstanding challenges directions future research despite tremendous potential computational social science advance sociological theory also creates numerous pressing challenges many valuable data sources fieldsuch data social media companiesare either inaccessible researchers accessible high status although variety initiatives underway address problem king persily 2019 ongoing controversy privacy data within public domain make collaborations difficult years come perhaps appropriately this field computational social science also creates range complex ethical issues salganik 2018 among others include balancing principles open science protection human subjects linking information across datasets without violating confidentiality broader set questions deeply researchers probe online lives subjectsparticularly cases people may know data generate online could analyzed others another set challenges concerns access training computational social science coding opensource software embedding field experiments online platforms dealing unconventional data structures part regular training within sociology departments although numerous online resources offer training techniques nevertheless require extensive domain knowledge geared toward social scientists aim repurpose digital data study human behavior the sicss designed fill gap providing training graduate students postdoctoral fellows junior faculty range techniques including web scraping automated text analysis digital experimentation ethics mass collaboration range subjects the sicss also seed interdisciplinary research connecting young scholars range social science stem fields 11 locations around world encouraging start research projects together although events provide temporary solution lack training computational social science hope departments consider including material within core curricula perhaps issues data access ethics training described computational social science yet broadly integrated many largest subfields sociology these include race ethnicity criminology education inequality stratification religion sex gender law medical sociology historical sociology religion many subfields it possible computational social science yet permeated subfields initial wave data created new communication technologies conducive pressing questions fields reviewed yet tremendous potential link new data sourcesalongside widespread digitization historical administrative archivesto address longstanding questions outside fields well to give examples digitization medical records might enable host new questions within medical sociology new data policing crime creates fertile ground new theorizing within criminology well see brayne 2020 in cases computational data methods might fruitfully combined panoply existing

theory behavior accounting behavior terms mechanisms supposed operate producing a generative explanation observed social phenomenon consists describing terms external environmental social internal behavioral mechanisms generate rather inferring causes observed covariations this vital property explanation easily realized otherwise when describing agent behavior means formalisms logicbased numeric describe behavior outside perceived observer describe way generated abm explains behavior within terms mechanisms supposed generated mechanisms operate agent she behaves one way another of course behavior explained otherwise for example flight hawks wonderfully explained mathematical property logarithmic spiral tangent center spiral yields angle width thanks property hawks keep preys always aim describing spiral pouncing but explanation generative sense tell us internal mechanisms allowing hawks fly way for sure hawks fly based understanding properties logarithmic spiral how show corresponding behavior the often invoked evolutionary explanation offers poor help accounts behavior terms reproductive advantage as spirallike flight proved advantageous hawks performed able generate offspring others extinguished no generative theory tells us hawks produce behavior question we could use mathematical theory describe behavior incorporate mathematical explanation set adhoc behavioral rules reproducing but neither mathematical explanation describes internal causes set adhoc rules generative now fully generative explanation implies general theory external causes including fitnessenhancing effects get converted internal reasons sometimes called proximate causes behavior agentbased models often limited focus easily compatible temporal perspective theoretical requirements fully generative sense intended explanation do always need generative explanation not really adhoc rules sometimes needed explain behavior this case entirely programmed organisms may even case hawks far know sometimes instead need suppose want hawk learn new trick respect approach behavior that nature form new environment perhaps letting imagination run wild form prey develops counterstrategy spiral then immediately flight generated becomes important much learned much hard wired plastic neuronal connection fixed relative placement eye bone suddenly reproduce behavior would need rigid set rules need know generated cognitive modeling aims finding general mechanisms yielding wide spectrum behaviors relatively autonomous systems of course need mechanisms simply reproduce behavior the specific target behavior lesser need cognitive agentbased model since abm often used investigate fairly specific phenomena either mathematical model set adhoc rule preferred cognitive modeling but together cognitive modeling also dispense away truly generative modeling 24 why bother with generative explanation one might say cares provided reproduce behavior observe make artificial experiments

steps associated set broader discussion relative benefits drawbacks algorithmic coder computational counterpart human coder coding protocol code sheet traditionally hypotheses research design finalized researcher must develop coding protocol set explicit detailed coding instructions human coder follow this turn requires researcher balance level instruction ensure neither detailed makes application instruction narrow protocol complex vague leaves much room interpretation thereby undermines reliability a simple code sheet developed coder listing every variable coded leaving room coder enter code with algorithmic coder room ambiguity coding protocol for example dictionarybased approach necessitates development extensive lists possible permutations distinct unitstypically words combinationsthat represent given construct eg victimization story frame see vliegenthart roggeband 2007 machine learning approaches require development clearly specified models identify patterns make inferences object study data typically calculating probability content certain class categorizing based highest probability eg grimmer 2010 the algorithmic coder employs lists words models instructions use coming form unambiguous computer code the lack ambiguity algorithmic approach sets apart traditional content analysis two reasons first requires researcher acutely aware many ways construct may manifest given text especially utilizing dictionarybased approach while researchers long needed awareness develop comprehensive codebooks traditional content analysis could rely judgment human coders adapt unusual manifestations algorithmic approach possible second may potentially facilitate replicability transparency ensuring every step along way clearly documented enables content
